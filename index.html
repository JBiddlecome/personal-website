      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an Operations and Project Manager based in Los Angeles with over 10 years of experience leading cross-functional teams,
        driving process improvements, and deploying AI-powered automation to enhance business performance. My background spans
        hospitality, staffing, technology, and operations strategy—streamlining workflows, cutting costs, and scaling organizational efficiency.
        I thrive at the intersection of people, process, and technology.

    <!-- Collapsible: AI Integrations -->
    <section id="ai" class="section collapsible" hidden>
      <h2>AI Integrations</h2>
      <p>
        At Culinary Staffing Services, I designed and implemented AI-driven workflows to automate onboarding, compliance tracking, and reporting. I also created an internal AI course for four teams that met monthly to train on AI implementation and to share and discuss emerging trends. Using AI, I automated payroll and HR reporting, improved compliance tracking, built an AI bot for internal SOPs and guides, developed several web apps to accelerate reporting workflows, and created new tools to improve employee communication. These systems collectively reduced HR labor by 97%, saved over 80 hours weekly, and enhanced operational transparency.
